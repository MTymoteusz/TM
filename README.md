A repository for my projects.
Both of the current projects were made in pairs with my coursemates.
## Pursuit Curves
A project developed with a friend of mine. First we found the differential equation of the problem, then solved it analytically.
Then, we used euler's method to compare the trajectory of the pursuer with the analytical method. After that, we used the central difference method with the same purpose. We then compared the two by calculating the relative error. Finally, we explored different trajectories of the pursuee. One of them made us particularily curious, so we analyzed it using the Fourier's function. The project resulted with a conclusion, that to this particular problem, the central difference method falls short on a longer time frame, but provides more accurate results at the beginning.
## Netflix films and series data analysis
Analysis of the data provided by Netflix, performed with a friend of mine. First, we cleaned the data. Then, we compared the amounts of films and series produced across time, with regard to certain countries. We then explored the length of the average production, and compared it to the general consensus of modern storytelling, especially in Hollywood and Bollywood. At the end, we found out which rating is the most popular among produced movies. The analysis resulted in us finding a strong correlation between the country of origin and the parameters explored.
